My task here was to create a CI/CD pipeline for an Azure Static Website utilising a GitHub repo.

I created some simple HTML in an index file for our main page then hosted it in Blob storage. Using a GitHub workflow in JSON allowing use of GitHub Acions to push updates to the index file. I mean to add an Azure Function such as a simple "Hello World" using python in the near future.
